This project focuses on identifying and removing suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions to improve security and performance. By reviewing installed extensions, checking their permissions, and researching their legitimacy, the task aims to help users understand how malicious add-ons can compromise privacy, track browsing activity, or slow down the browser. Unused or suspicious extensions were removed, and the browser was restarted to observe performance improvements. This activity highlights the importance of regularly monitoring browser extensions to maintain a safe and efficient browsing experience.
