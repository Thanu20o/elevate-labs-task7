Looked up reviews and ratings on the Chrome Web Store for authenticity.

Found some extensions that were not in regular use or seemed unnecessary.
Verified if any were installed without clear knowledge or had bad reviews online.

Inject unwanted ads or redirect web traffic.
Slow down browsing speed or consume system resources.
